Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Github is a well known platform that is easy to use and many of us might already be used to using. 
It is also especially good for collaboration and experimentation due to the ability to make branches-  
making it possible for group members work on different parts at the same time and then discard or merge 
them at the end.
