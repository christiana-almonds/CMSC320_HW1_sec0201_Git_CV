Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Github is a well known platform that is easy to use and many of us might already be used to using. 
It is also especially good for collaboration and experimentation due to the ability to make branches-  
making it possible for group members work on different parts at the same time and then discard or merge 
them at the end.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: One example is with weather forecasting since AI models built on data science
can more accurately predict the affects of large sclae weather veents such as hurricanes
compared tp physics based models and can in turn help with agriculture and a lot of other
areas. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging works by showing the history of the project in branches while rebasing works linearly. 
Because of this merging shows history as it happened while rebasing rewrites it.
